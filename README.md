“It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages”

― Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature & Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Vol 1

   - We are grateful that this pragmatic compromise cam to fruition
   - Proof is in the pudding
   - Firing of Sam Altman and the ensuring drama merely reinforced this stance

- Transparency
  - Altman's board claimed he wasn't forthwright with them
  - Foucault will remind us about power structures
  - Will-to-Power if you will
    
- Cost-efficiency
  - Philanthropy and benefit to humanity is not a sustainable model
- Exclusive [datasets](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3531146.3533231)
  - Mostly exclusive access to sufficienet tokens for computing demands
  - This is the true limiting factor
- Deep expertise
  - Market place believed he and team had deep expertise
  - Leaving him out there would disadvantage OpenAI
