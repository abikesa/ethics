“It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages”

― Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature & Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Vol 1

6. Motiv
   - Agent
   - What motivates the agent
   - Self-interest or benefit to humanity?
   - From an aesthetic perspective its self-interest
   - Adam Smith's key aesthetic argument agrees to
   - Moral stance of OpenAI charter proved itself a contradition
   - To think that ChatGPT wasn't even the goal but merely "compromise"?
   - We are grateful that this pragmatic compromise cam to fruition
   - Proof is in the pudding
   - Firing of Sam Altman and the ensuring drama merely reinforced this stance

     - Via prosaic surface structure
     - Ultimately to poetic or `metaphoric` super-surface
     - Emergence of ambiguity
       
   - Meaning/Semantics
     - How meaningful is ambiguity?
     - Thats the difference between poetry and prose

1. Icons
   - OpenAI, Adam Smith, Moral Philosophy
   - Insincerity of "philanthropy"

2. Cost-efficiency
   - Adjective describing self-interest vs. beneficence to humanity
   - Philanthropy and benefit to humanity is not a sustainable model
   - Presented a `bias-variance` trade-off
   - OpenAI board and [mission statement](https://openai.com) should be investigated
   - From humanities human, all-to-human errors, we keep getting the best out our race!

3. Exclusive [datasets](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3531146.3533231)
   - In one mode something are possible and others aren't (think `blue notes`)
   - Mostly exclusive access to sufficienet tokens for computing demands
   - This is the true limiting factor

4. Deep expertise
   - Subject, agency, principal
   - Market place believed he and team had deep expertise
   - Leaving him out there would disadvantage OpenAI

5. Transparency
   - Process and more
   - Altman's board claimed he wasn't forthwright with them
   - Foucault will remind us about power structures
   - Will-to-Power if you will

6. `Object`
   - `Semantics`
   - Meaning of it all
   - Derives from `Syntax` & Structures Foucault would point us to
   - Agency of the subject, "doer", and consent of object, "recipient"
   - Foucault would also take us back to `Phonology` and "voir": visibility of these structures to all at play
   - Ultimate meaning lies in costs of process, quality of dataset, and exclusivity to those in power (e.g. owners of land and platforms)
